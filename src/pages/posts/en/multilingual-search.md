**Algolia’s search engine supports all writing systems and [many languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/),** 

*including symbol-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese.* 

Algolia also handles multiple languages on the same website/app, 

> meaning some users could search in French and some in English, using the same Algolia account.

The purpose of this guide is to explain how to organize your indices to enable multi-language search.
